# swift java php csharp react-native tutorial

** This will be temp tutorial for people want to link their web
to the mobile apps . 

It will be basic CRUD - create read update delete 
It will teach you how to use proper PHP,asp.net core code rather than after market
LARAVEL , PDO . If you understand the basic, doesn't matter what framework
you used it will be same method 

** the future version will introduce .net core c# . Sorry not familiar 
with python ,perl, ruby code but maybe in the future .

We only use POST  
We don't use GET because GET got limitation, and the proper is to 
retrieve data 
We don't use PUT /DELETE because PHP don't like it 

The Sample will be record, the call API will be using POSTMAN
. We urge new developer new rely on just used for postman because it doesn't
detect cross domain problem . Make a sample javascript /jquery 
to test your API.
